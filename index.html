    <h2>Put in the time.</h2>
    <p>Whenever i am approaching a new task or Challenge, my biggest concern is not knowing how much time I need to put into it in the beginning.</p>
    <br /> 
    <h2>Be patient.</h2>
    <p>It is very hard to imagine or picture yourself knowing how to do something, when you are struggling to grasp or get a hang of it right now.</p>
    <br /> 
    <h2>Overcome frustration.

    </h2> 
    <p>I often tend to question everything and my own abilities to do anything right when I find myself unable to do a task and facing frustration</p>
    <br /> 
    <h2>Team Up</h2>
    <p>Working with others who may have better skills and more experience is intimidating. You feel like you can't really do much because other people already know everything and you don't know as much as they do.</p>
